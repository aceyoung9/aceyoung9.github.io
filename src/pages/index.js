    <p>
      I’m a front-end developer at Tank Design. I love writing weird CSS and
      even weirder JavaScript. Not incomprehensibly weird, or utterly
      unextendable by others. Just mildly funky code.

      These days, I’m trying to learn more about design systems. Also how to
      maintain a bicycle.

      I used to have a very pretty website with lots of artwork. One day all
      those paintings of dead birds will be moved here.
